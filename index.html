		<h2>Home</h2>
		<p><strong>Open communication and honesty</strong>, I believe that open communication between employees, management, and clients is core for an efficient workplace. I value an employer’s and co-workers who communicate effectively and honestly between one another to obtain the goals of the company.</p>
		<p><strong>Freedom of development</strong>, I believe that having the freedom to develop and improve oneself is important in today’s world of IT. The ability to provide an environment in which a person can develop their skills on any subject matter is important to making a better, stronger individual.</p>
		<p><strong>Freedom of knowledge</strong>, I believe that there is always something one can learn from any individual no matter their experience or background. I believe that an environment that stimulates the transfer of knowledge between coworkers is beneficial to any company and helps to round off an individual.</p>
		<p><strong>Freedom of technology</strong>, I value open source software and projects. They provide an individual with powerful tools to take advantage of that can be further developed and refined. A company that supports and gives back to the open source community is a powerful and respectable company. I believe these values are important for a company to believe in. It allows for their IT employees to continually develop, trust, and experience new things in a world that is always changing.</p>
